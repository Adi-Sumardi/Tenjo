# Streaming Refactor & Bug Fix Summary (2025-09-15)

## Overview
Refactored `client/src/modules/stream_handler.py` to address stability, performance, and compatibility issues between the Python client and Laravel backend streaming endpoints.

## Key Fixes
- Added missing `start_streaming()` method (alias) referenced by `main.py`.
- Added robust worker `_video_worker` with:
  - Reduced CPU usage (15 FPS, 640x360) and adjustable JPEG quality.
  - Guarded `mss` and multi-monitor handling (fallback to index 0).
  - Per-frame error isolation (loop continues on exception).
  - Adaptive timeout & exponential-style backoff for upload failures.
  - Metrics/log rate limiting (every 30s) to avoid log spam.
- Removed unused memory list (`video_buffer`).
- Added automatic auth header propagation from `APIClient` to streaming `Session`.
- Improved stop logic with explicit boolean return and longer join timeout.
- Added comprehensive docstring explaining addressed issues.
- Normalized resolution/metadata to match backend expectations (`frame`, `frame_number`, `codec`, `encoding`).
- Safer path augmentation and runtime checks for OpenCV / MSS presence.

## Risk Mitigation
- Backwards-compatible public API retained (`start_video_streaming`, new alias `start_streaming`, `stop_video_streaming`).
- No external dependency additions.
- Fallback exit if OpenCV/MSS imports fail; avoids hanging threads.

## Added Test
`client/test_stream_handler_basic.py` â€“ validates start/stop lifecycle; confirms no exceptions and reports failure count.

## Next Recommendations
1. Implement authentication / signing for streaming frames (HMAC or token per session) to prevent spoofing.
2. Add server-side frame rate limiting & size validation.
3. Introduce optional WebSocket transport for lower latency vs per-frame HTTP POST.
4. Add integration test hitting `/api/video/{clientId}` with a mocked server.
5. Track average upload latency and dynamic quality adaptation (lower quality on sustained failures).

## Verification
- Basic lifecycle test executed successfully (start/stop) with zero upload failures in local environment.
- Static analysis: no syntax errors in modified file.
